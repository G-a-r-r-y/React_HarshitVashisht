1. React:
    Let’s create reusable pieces of UI called components.
    Helps you build user interfaces (UIs) in JavaScript.
    Makes it easy to update and show UI changes based on data.
    
2. React DOM:
    Specifically deals with showing React components on web pages.
    Without ReactDOM, React wouldn’t know how to display things on a web page.
    Takes care of connecting your React code to the actual HTML on a webpage.

In simple terms, React is like the architect who designs how things should look, 
and ReactDOM is the construction worker who puts those designs into action on a website. 
If you’re building web pages with React, you use both React and ReactDOM.

Functions name should always start with a Capital letter because of react rules

-->
We use className instead of class cause class word is reserved.

For JSX syntax - 
1. First change the type of your js to type="text/jsx"
2. Connect Babel (converts jsx to actual react code)
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards 
compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. 

Note - can call function in jsx with <FunctionName/>
